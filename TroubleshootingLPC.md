## Permission denied (gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)

1. This error appeared after installing `conda` on my mac. Initially, I did not install this and was logging into LPC without any issues. The steps I followed to resolve this issue cann be found on the documentation here: https://uscms.org/uscms_at_work/physics/computing/getstarted/uaf.shtml#MacBigSur. 

2. I followed the steps under the section "Anaconda/conda/pip/MacPorts errors" and restarted my mac for the chages to take place. It was fixed only after restarting my computer. Thus, just restarting my terminal was not enough.
